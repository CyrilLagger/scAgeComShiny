The goal of scAgeComShiny is to provide a Shiny App to explore how
intercellular communication changes with age in 23 mouse tissues.

The online version of this App can be accessed here (in preparation).

## Installation

You can also install a local version of scAgeComShiny with:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CyrilLagger/scAgeComShiny")
```

Note that the dataset required to build the App is not included in this 
repository (link in preparation).

## Reference

This Shiny App has been built with [golem](https://golemverse.org/packages_list/golem/).
